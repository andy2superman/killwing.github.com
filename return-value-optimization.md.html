## Standard
[C++11 Standard](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3337.pdf) 12.8 Copying and moving class objects
C++11和C++98/03没有大的区别，加入了move操作。

31.
> When certain criteria are met, an implementation is allowed to omit the copy/move construction of a class
object, even if the copy/move constructor and/or destructor for the object have side effects. In such cases,
the implementation treats the source and target of the omitted copy/move operation as simply two different
ways of referring to the same object, and the destruction of that object occurs at the later of the times
when the two objects would have been destroyed without the optimization. This elision of copy/move
operations, called copy elision, is permitted in the following circumstances (which may be combined to
eliminate multiple copies):
- in a return statement in a function with a class return type, **when the expression is the name of a
non-volatile automatic object (other than a function or catch-clause parameter) with the same cvunqualified
type as the function return type, the copy/move operation can be omitted by constructing
the automatic object directly into the function's return value**
- in a throw-expression, when the operand is the name of a non-volatile automatic object (other than a
function or catch-clause parameter) whose scope does not extend beyond the end of the innermost
enclosing try-block (if there is one), the copy/move operation from the operand to the exception
object can be omitted by constructing the automatic object directly into the exception object
- **when a temporary class object that has not been bound to a reference would be copied/moved
to a class object with the same cv-unqualified type, the copy/move operation can be omitted by
constructing the temporary object directly into the target of the omitted copy/move**
- when the exception-declaration of an exception handler declares an object of the same type
(except for cv-qualification) as the exception object, the copy/move operation can be omitted
by treating the exception-declaration as an alias for the exception object if the meaning of the program
will be unchanged except for the execution of constructors and destructors for the object declared by
the exception-declaration.

1. return一个局部变量（必须直接返回同类型的变量名或匿名，不能是此函数或catch语句的参数，不能是条件表达式），可以将此变量直接构造在返回值里（临时对象）以节省一次copy/move。
1. 如果一个临时对象没有绑定在引用（左值或右值）上，这个临时对象可以直接构造在同类型的目标对象里（接收变量）以节省一次copy/move。

以上2点可以同时作用(1+2)，不生成临时对象以节省两次copy/move。

32.
> **When the criteria for elision of a copy operation are met or would be met save for the fact that the source
object is a function parameter, and the object to be copied is designated by an lvalue, overload resolution to
select the constructor for the copy is first performed as if the object were designated by an rvalue.** If overload
resolution fails, or if the type of the first parameter of the selected constructor is not an rvalue reference to
the object's type (possibly cv-qualified), overload resolution is performed again, considering the object as an
lvalue. [ Note: This two-stage overload resolution must be performed regardless of whether copy elision will
occur. It determines the constructor to be called if elision is not performed, and **the selected constructor
must be accessible even if the call is elided.** -- end note ]

当31的条件满足的时候，即使被copy的对象是左值，也会被优先当作右值来决定选择copy还是move构造函数（不管是否会优化而不被调用到）。
即使可以省去copy/move构造函数的调用，copy/move构造函数也不能是私有。


## Compiler Option
一般大部分编译器都默认打开此优化。
g++/clang++里禁用：-fno-elide-constructors
> The C++ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a temporary which is only used to initialize another object of the same type.
Specifying this option disables that optimization, and forces G++ to call the copy constructor in all cases.

临时对象指编译器直接生成的用于构造返回值的对象。
引用（左值或右值）一个临时变量可以延长其生命周期与此引用一样。


## Verification
### Test Class

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class A {
public:
    A() {
        std::cout << "ctor" << std::endl;
    }

    ~A() {
        std::cout << "dtor" << std::endl;
    }

    A(const A&) {
        std::cout << "cptor" << std::endl;
    }

    A(A&&) {
        std::cout << "mvtor" << std::endl;
    }
};

A g;

A f1() {
    return A();
}

A f2() {
    A a;
    return a;
}

A f3(const A& a) {
    return a;
}

A f4(A a) {
    return a;
}

A f5() {
    A a;
    return std::move(a);
}

A f6(bool b = true) {
    A a;
    return b ? a : a;
}

A f7(bool b = true) {
    A a;
    if (b) {
        return a;
    } else {
        return a;
    }
}

A f8() {
    return g;
}

A& f9() {
    A a;
    return a;
}

A& f10(A a) {
    return a;
}

A&& f11() {
    A a;
    return std::move(a);
}
```

### Test Results
`A x = f1();`
ctor // unnamed is constructed as x, no temp (1+2)
dtor

`A x = f2();`
ctor // a is constructed as x, no temp (1+2)
dtor

`const A& x = f2();`
ctor // a is constructed as temp, const-l-ref x to temp (1)
dtor

`A&& x = f2();`
ctor // a is constructed as temp, r-ref x to temp (1)
dtor

`A x = f3(g);`
cptor // temp is copy constructed as x by a (2)
dtor

`A x = f4(g);`
cptor // a is copy constructed by g
mvtor // temp is move constructed as x by a (2)
dtor
dtor

`A x = f5();`
ctor // a is constructed
mvtor // temp is move constructed as x by a (2)
dtor
dtor

`A x = f6();`
ctor // a is constructed
cptor // temp is copy constructed as x by a (2)
dtor
dtor

`A x = f7();`
ctor // a is constructed as x, no temp (1+2)
dtor

`A x = f8();`
cptor // temp is copy constructed as x by g (2)
dtor

`f9/f10/f11`
不应返回局部变量的引用，右值引用也是引用。
